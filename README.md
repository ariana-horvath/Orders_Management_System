# Orders_Management_System

This project desins and implements an Order Management application for processing client orders for a warehouse. Relational databases are used to store the products, the clients and the orders. 

* The orders management application allows users to select the table/entity to be processed, i.e. Client, Product and Order.
*  For each of these, the application allows user to perform the CRUD operations (Create, Read, 
Update and Delete) that will be saved in the database.
*  The application validates input and make modifications in the database only if the clients, 
products or orders are valid.
*  The application creates a bill (in a .txt file) for every order made. 

Non-Functional requirements
* The orders management application should be intuitive and easy to use by the user.
* The orders management application should not allow the user to introduce invalid input.
* The orders management application should warn the user if the input is not valid or empty.
